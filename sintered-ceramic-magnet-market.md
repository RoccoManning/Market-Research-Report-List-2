<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sintered Ceramic Magnet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Pressing</li><li>Wet Press Molding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sintered Ceramic Magnet Market Types: </p><p>Dry Pressing - In the dry pressing method, ceramic powders are compacted into desired shapes using pressure without the presence of any liquid. The powders are pressed together in a mold, resulting in a dense and rigid magnet structure with high magnetic properties.</p><p>Wet Press Molding - Wet press molding involves the use of a liquid binder to hold the ceramic powders together during the molding process. The powders and binder are mixed to form a slurry, which is then pressed into a mold. After pressing, the molded magnets are dried and sintered to obtain the desired magnetic properties. This method allows for complex shapes and precise control over magnet dimensions.</p></p>

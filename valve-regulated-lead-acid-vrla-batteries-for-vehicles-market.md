<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) Batteries for Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gel Cell</li><li>Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries are a type of rechargeable battery commonly used in vehicles. There are two main market types within VRLA batteries: Gel Cell and Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM). Gel Cell batteries use a thickening agent to immobilize the electrolyte, making them highly resistant to vibration and suitable for deep cycling applications. AGM batteries, on the other hand, use fiberglass mat separators to hold the electrolyte, allowing for high energy density, faster recharge rates, and better performance in high-demand situations. Both types offer efficient and maintenance-free power for vehicles.</p></p>

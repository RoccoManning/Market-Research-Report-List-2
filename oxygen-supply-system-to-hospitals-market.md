<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygen Supply System to Hospitals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cylinder Manifold System</li><li>Liquid Oxygen System</li><li>Oxygen Concentrator System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oxygen supply system in hospitals is crucial for providing life-saving oxygen to patients. There are three types of oxygen supply systems commonly used in hospitals. </p><p>1. Cylinder Manifold System: This system involves using high-pressure cylinders filled with oxygen that are connected to a manifold system. The manifold distributes the oxygen to different areas of the hospital through a network of pipes, ensuring a continuous supply of oxygen.</p><p>2. Liquid Oxygen System: In this system, oxygen is stored in liquid form in large tanks or containers. The liquid oxygen is then converted into gas and distributed through a network of pipes to various hospital areas, ensuring a continuous supply.</p><p>3. Oxygen Concentrator System: This system utilizes oxygen concentrators, which are machines that extract oxygen from the ambient air and deliver it to patients. The concentrators filter out other gases, providing a high concentration of oxygen that can be used directly by the patients.</p><p>Each of these systems plays a crucial role in ensuring that hospitals have a reliable and continuous supply of oxygen for their patients' needs.</p></p>

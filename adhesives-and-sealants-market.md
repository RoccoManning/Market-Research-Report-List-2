<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adhesives and Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching Adhesive</li><li>Selective-etching Adhesive</li><li>Total-etching Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Adhesives and sealants market types can be categorized into self-etching, selective-etching, and total-etching adhesives. Self-etching adhesive refers to a type of adhesive that contains both an etchant and adhesive component. It eliminates the need for separate etching, simplifying the bonding process. Selective-etching adhesive allows for the selective removal of specific tooth structures to enhance bonding. Lastly, total-etching adhesive involves the complete removal of the tooth's enamel and dentin, providing a strong base for adhesive bonding. These different market types cater to diverse dental bonding needs.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Adhesives and Sealants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Restoration Bonding</li><li>Indirect Restoration Bonding</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Adhesives and sealants are widely used in the dental industry for various applications. Direct restoration bonding refers to the process of bonding dental materials, such as composites, directly to teeth surfaces. This technique is commonly used for filling cavities or repairing chipped teeth. On the other hand, indirect restoration bonding involves the bonding of prosthetic restorations, such as crowns or bridges, to teeth using adhesives and sealants. This helps in restoring the functionality and aesthetics of damaged or missing teeth. These applications play a crucial role in dental restorations, ensuring long-lasting and reliable solutions.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio Methane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fermentation</li><li>Gasification</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bio Methane market can be classified into two types: fermentation and gasification. Fermentation is a process that involves the breakdown of organic materials, such as agricultural waste and food waste, by microorganisms to produce methane gas. This method is commonly used in biogas plants. On the other hand, gasification is a thermochemical process where organic materials, such as wood chips or crop residues, are converted into a syngas, which is a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and methane. This syngas can then be further processed to produce bio methane. Both fermentation and gasification methods present sustainable ways to produce bio methane for various energy applications.</p></p>

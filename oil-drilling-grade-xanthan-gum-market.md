<p><strong>Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>CP Kelco is a leading global producer of specialty hydrocolloids, including xanthan gum. The company was founded in 1928 as the Central California Canning Company and later changed its name to California Pectin Corporation. In 1949, it developed a new process to extract pectin, which led to its rapid growth. Over the years, CP Kelco expanded its product portfolio and entered the xanthan gum market in the early 1960s. Today, it is one of the largest xanthan gum producers globally.</p><p>ADM, also known as Archer Daniels Midland, is a multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation. It was founded in 1902 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. ADM entered the xanthan gum market through its acquisition of the Swiss company Wild Flavors in 2014. Wild Flavors had been producing xanthan gum as part of its ingredient solutions portfolio. With its global presence and wide distribution network, ADM has become a major player in the competitive oil drilling grade xanthan gum market.</p><p>Cargill, an American privately held corporation, was established in 1865 and is headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota. It is one of the largest privately held companies in the world, with operations in multiple industries, including agriculture, food processing, and various other sectors. Cargill entered the xanthan gum market through its acquisition of Cerestar, a European starch and sweeteners manufacturer, in 2002.

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chiral Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional Separation Method</li><li>Asymmetric Preparation Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chiral material market can be classified into two types: traditional separation method and asymmetric preparation method. In the traditional separation method, chiral compounds are separated from a mixture using techniques like chromatography or crystallization. This method can be time-consuming and costly. On the other hand, the asymmetric preparation method involves the synthesis of chiral compounds using catalysts or enzymes to selectively produce one enantiomer over the other. This method offers higher selectivity and efficiency, making it a preferred choice in the chiral material market.</p></p>

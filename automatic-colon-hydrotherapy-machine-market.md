<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Colon Hydrotherapy Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open System</li><li>Close System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automatic Colon Hydrotherapy Machine market consists of two types: open system and closed system. In an open system, water flows through a tube and into the rectum, with waste materials flowing back out through the same tube. Closed system machines, on the other hand, use a specialized disposable speculum attachable to the rectum to allow water to enter and waste materials to exit through separate tubes. Both systems offer similar benefits, but the closed system is considered more hygienic and allows for greater privacy during the procedure.</p></p>

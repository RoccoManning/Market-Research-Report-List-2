<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi-strand Anchor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tensile</li><li>Compressive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multi-strand anchor market can be categorized into two types based on their application: tensile and compressive. Tensile market refers to the use of multi-strand anchors in applications where the primary load is in tension, such as bridges or tall buildings. These anchors are designed to withstand pulling forces and provide stability. On the other hand, compressive market pertains to the utilization of multi-strand anchors in applications where the primary load is in compression, such as retaining walls or foundations. In this case, the anchors are employed to resist pushing forces and ensure structural integrity.</p></p>

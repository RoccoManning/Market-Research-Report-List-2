The convenience and ease of use offered by nicotine lozenges make them a popular choice among individuals looking to quit smoking.</p><p>However, the market growth may be hindered by factors such as the availability of alternative smoking cessation products and the potential side effects associated with nicotine usage. Additionally, the increasing popularity of e-cigarettes and vaping devices among smokers may provide alternative options for nicotine consumption, leading to a decline in the demand for nicotine lozenges.</p><p>Overall, the nicotine lozenges market is projected to witness steady growth in the coming years, driven by the increasing number of smokers attempting to quit and the advancements in product formulation and technology. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% during the forecasted period.</p></p>

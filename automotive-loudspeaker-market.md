<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Loudspeaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Horn</li><li>Electric Horn</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive loudspeaker market consists of two main types: air horns and electric horns. Air horns are loudspeakers that produce sound by blowing air through a reed or diaphragm, creating a powerful and resonating noise. They are commonly used in trucks and large vehicles to produce a distinct and attention-grabbing sound. On the other hand, electric horns operate by using electromagnetic coils to vibrate a diaphragm, generating a loud and clear sound. These are commonly found in smaller vehicles and provide a more compact and efficient option for producing sound.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto Suspension System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Auto Suspension System</li><li>Non-independent Auto Suspension System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The auto suspension system market consists of independent and non-independent types. Independent auto suspension systems refer to each wheel operating independently, allowing for better control and comfort during driving. They typically include components like coil springs, shock absorbers, and control arms. On the other hand, non-independent auto suspension systems connect both wheels on each axle, resulting in the movement of one wheel affecting the other. This type is simpler and less expensive, commonly found in older vehicles or those with lower performance requirements.</p></p>

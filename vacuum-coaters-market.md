<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Coaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Suspension Type</li><li>Roller Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Vacuum coaters are divided into two main types in the market: suspension type and roller type. Suspension type vacuum coaters operate by suspending the substrates in a vacuum chamber and spraying the coating material onto them. This method allows for uniform and precise coating applications. On the other hand, roller type vacuum coaters involve placing the substrates on rotating rollers, which are then coated with the material as they pass through the chamber. This type is known for its high-speed coating process and is commonly used in industries such as printing and packaging.</p></p>

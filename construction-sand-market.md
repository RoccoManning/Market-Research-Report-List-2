<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Sand Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Sand</li><li>Synthetic Sand</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Construction sand is classified into two major types: natural sand and synthetic sand. Natural sand is obtained from rivers, lakes, and sea beds through erosion and weathering processes. It is commonly used in construction due to its fine particles and good binding properties. On the other hand, synthetic sand is produced through industrial processes such as crushing rocks or using by-products from various industries. Despite being artificial, synthetic sand can replicate the properties of natural sand and is often used in construction applications where a consistent and reliable supply is required.</p></p>

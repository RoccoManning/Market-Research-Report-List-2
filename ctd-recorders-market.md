<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CTD Recorders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Profiling CTD</li><li>Moored CTD</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>CTD recorders are used in oceanography to measure conductivity, temperature, and depth in seawater. These recorders come in different types, including profiling CTD and moored CTD. Profiling CTDs are deployed from a ship and can take measurements throughout the water column as they move up and down. They are commonly used to study oceanographic features like temperature and salinity gradients. On the other hand, moored CTDs are fixed in one location in the water and provide continuous measurements over a long period. They are often used to monitor long-term changes in the ocean's properties.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Synchronous Belts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic PU</li><li>Thermoset PU</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane synchronous belts are a type of industrial belts that are used in various applications such as power transmission, robotics, and packaging. They are available in two main types: thermoplastic PU and thermoset PU. Thermoplastic PU belts are made from materials that can be melted and reformed multiple times, making them more flexible and resistant to wear. Thermoset PU belts, on the other hand, are made from materials that are cured and cannot be melted again, resulting in a more rigid and durable belt. Both types of belts offer different advantages and are chosen based on specific application requirements.</p></p>

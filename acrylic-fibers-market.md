<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning Acrylic Fibers</li><li>Dry Spinning Acrylic Fibers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acrylic fibers are commonly produced through two main types of spinning methods: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving the acrylic polymer in a solvent to create a spinning solution that is extruded into a coagulating bath, where the fibers solidify. This method produces fibers with high tenacity and good dyeability. On the other hand, dry spinning involves dissolving the acrylic polymer in a solvent, which is then spun into heated air to evaporate the solvent and solidify the fibers. This method is typically used to produce fibers with a higher level of bulk and softness.</p></p>

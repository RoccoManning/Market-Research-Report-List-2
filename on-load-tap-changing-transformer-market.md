<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The On-Load Tap Changing Transformer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum</li><li>Oil-immersed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The On-Load Tap Changing (OLTC) Transformer market is categorized into two main types: vacuum and oil-immersed transformers. Vacuum OLTC transformers use vacuum interrupters to control the tap changing process, ensuring efficient power regulation and minimizing electrical losses. These transformers are smaller, more compact, and require less maintenance than their oil-immersed counterparts. On the other hand, oil-immersed OLTC transformers use oil as an insulating and cooling medium. They are larger in size and require regular maintenance to preserve the transformer's insulation and cooling properties. Both types serve the purpose of adjusting the transformer's secondary voltage to maintain a steady output voltage level.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Sleep Monitoring Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart sleep monitoring equipment includes both contact and contactless technology. Contact sleep monitoring equipment uses sensors or electrodes that are placed directly on the body to measure brain activity, heart rate, and other physiological data during sleep. This type of equipment provides highly accurate measurements but may be uncomfortable for some users. On the other hand, contactless sleep monitoring equipment uses non-invasive methods such as radar or radio waves to detect and analyze sleep patterns without any physical contact with the body. It offers convenience and comfort, but the accuracy may vary compared to contact-based devices.</p></p>

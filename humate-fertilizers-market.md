<p><strong>The Humate Fertilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Type</li><li>Liquid Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Humate fertilizers are categorized into two main types: solid type and liquid type. Solid type humate fertilizers are typically granular or powdered formulations that are applied to the soil or mixed with other fertilizers before application. They provide slow-release nutrients and improve soil structure. On the other hand, liquid type humate fertilizers are concentrated solutions that are mixed with water and applied directly to the soil or foliage. They are quickly absorbed by plants and provide immediate nutrition. Both types of humate fertilizers contribute to improving plant growth, yield, and overall soil health.</p></p>
